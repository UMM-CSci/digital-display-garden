# Digital Display Garden
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/UMM-CSci-3601-S17/digital-display-garden-iteration-4-revolverenguardia-1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/UMM-CSci-3601-S17/digital-display-garden-iteration-4-revolverenguardia-1)  
This is a project for the West Central Research Outreach Center (WCROC) in Morris Minnesota, to design software that would enhance visitor experience at their horticulture gardens, and provide feedback for WCROC. The Digital Display Garden allows visitors to learn more about the garden, and leave feedback for garden staff, all in a non-obtrusive, low footprint way that doesn't take away from aesthetics of the garden.  
 
Visitors can access the Digital Display Garden via QR Codes located at each bed. From there, visitors can rate, comment, and view information about the garden. Meanwhile, WCROC staff, can track when and where in the garden people are viewing, liking, and commenting on plants through interactive graphics, and exportable spreadsheets.  
 
In addition, The Digital Display Garden was designed with low maintenance in mind. WCROC staff can populate the website by uploading a single excel spreadsheet that they already use to keep track of plants into our Admin console. From there, they can change what data the Digital Display Garden is working from, by uploading a corrected spreadsheet using our update function. Getting the correct QR codes for each bed in the garden is a simple as using our *Download QR Codes* feature, that downloads a zipped folder containing all the QR codes needed for the garden. They can regularly view real time data about the garden by using our charts feature, or can download an excel spreadsheet with complete data from all of the garden.   
  
The Digital Display Garden is due to enter service in the WCROC garden, during summer 2017, and will be further developed to improve visitor and staff experience alike. This project is made possible by the students, and faculty of C-SCI 3601, *Software Development and Design*, at University of Minnesota Morris, and by the staff of the West Central Research Outreach Center.
